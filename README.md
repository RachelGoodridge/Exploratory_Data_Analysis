## Construction Work on MTA System at the Lexington Ave / 59 St Subway Station
By: Rachel Goodridge

## Abstract
Through interpretation of [MTA Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) for the Lexington Ave/59th Street subway station in Manhattan, an optimal time for closing this station for Huff construction company to complete some repairs was determined. Data was ingested using SQLite and processed in Python with pandas. Results showed the least amount of traffic at the station on average occurs between midnight and 4am on weekdays, and thus, this would be a good time to close the station to complete the work.
